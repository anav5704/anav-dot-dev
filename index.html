        <h2>Tech I like</h2>

        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org/">Next JS</a> - This makes building fullstack apps so goddamn easy and quick. It definitely has it flaws but covers it up with it's massive pool of features and amazing developer experience.</p>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://astro.build/">Astro JS</a> - This was one of the first frameworks I learnt while moving to component based development. I've had a blast making all of my Astro blogs, it's fun and simple.</p>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> - Getting used to this was painful, but now it's basically a requirement for any website I build. Also love their color palettes, it's vibrant and never disappoints.</p>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.prisma.io/">Prisma</a> - This got me interested into databases, like how relationships  work and different types of constraints. Huge fan of the syntax and Prisma Studio (sorry Drizzle).</p>
